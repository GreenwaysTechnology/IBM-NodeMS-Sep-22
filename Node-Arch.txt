				Node.js Architecture
.....................................................................................

What is Node.js?

 Node.js is a platform to run js code outside web browser.
 Platform means collection of tools,libs/apis,runtime in order to build end to end apps.

Why Node.js Was Created?

 Before Node.js, There was no arch for building application particullar networkbased apps using nonblocking /async programming model.


How programs works?

Program is collection of instructions

Program has two types

1.source program 
   The program is written any language
2.compiled program
   The program is compiled by compiler of any language

The compiled program is executed ; loading on main memory so that cpu can access.

in order to run the program , we need another program - process/Runtime.

The process runs the program always sequentially- line by line.

eg:
 instructions1 -----|running---
 instructions2
 instructions3
 instructionsN
     |
  Process(runtime)

while instructions1 is running,the instructions2 cant be executed - Blocking

instructions2 is blocked because of instruction1

instructions1 lets say would be io call (reading from the file,or from network socket socket)
 
can we run all instructions simultaneously?
 Yes!
Threads
 
 T1--instructions1 -----|running---
 T2--instructions2
 T3--instructions3
 TN--instructionsN

What is io? What is Blocking Io? What is Nonblocking io?
.....................................................................................
				 File Descriptors
.....................................................................................

1.File descriptors is  program written in c language- array
2.File descriptor is associated with every process on os- if you run more than one process - will have more file descriptor table

FD arch:
Integer value	Name	<unistd.h> symbolic constant[1]	<stdio.h> file stream[2]
0	Standard input	STDIN_FILENO	stdin
1	Standard output	STDOUT_FILENO	stdout
2	Standard error	STDERR_FILENO	stderr

 data= readFile() -----|running---
 calculate()
 add()
 mulitply()


Process:
1.we use language high level api to start reading file from the disk
  java:
   FileInputStream fins= newFileInputStream("c:/tmp/version.txt")
   fins.read()

 java uses read api--------|jvm----will call c api(os api)---->kernal--fd

2.we use language high level api to start reading data from the network(Remote computer)
  java:
 java uses readSocket------i--------|jvm----will call c api(os api)---->kernal--fd

Network io and web server:

Any web server if you take, it works based on io model- socket-network io.

Traditional web server,  for every client request is  handled inside server by a thread.

                    "Request Per Thread model"
			
.....................................................................................
Drawbacks of Request Per Thread Model.
   1000 req = 1000 thread
   1 million = 1 million threads

if webserver starts receiving more and more load, they cant handle request.
The problem was called as "C10K" Problem

c10k Problem:
The C10k problem is the problem of optimizing network sockets to handle a large number of clients at the same time. The name C10k is a numeronym for concurrently handling ten thousand connections.
 
 if a webserver handles 10 thousand connections(threads) at the same time , it is good webserver".

....................................................................................
        C10k Problem aims to handle more request with min "Resource"
....................................................................................

Here Resource means threads.
How to reduce thread to handle more users.
 Having limited no of threads how to handle more request.

Why should i reduce thread? what is problem with threads?

Evils of Thread:
 ->Thread is subject to memory.
 ->Thread is subject to cpu, cpu need to do lot of ctx switch.
 ->Thread inter communication causes thread dead locks
....................................................................................
Solution:
 Having  a limited no of threads , at least one or two.

In 2000, The linux operating system introduced an api which is non blocking io api 

1.select + read
  In this model thread is not blocked because of io, but thread has to make an explicit read call for data ,once the data is ready.
  because of this another api been introduced

2.poll
  Poll eleminated extra read call from the application. rather kernal push the data when is available - Event Driven Programming model.

3.EPoll:
  It is a framework, introduced in linux to handle non blocking operations using event driven programming model.

monitoring   multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of
       them.  
EPoll introduced a concept called "event loop"

event loop syntax:
 for (;;) {



 }

Event Loop:

Any similar arch/technology available today like node.js?

Java - with Netty
Java with Vertx
Java with Quarkus

What type apps we can build using Node.js?

You can build  concurrent non blocking network io apps...

....................................................................................

Node.js platform has been built on 

Google v8 : javascript engine  to execute js program
libuv :  It is operating system non blocking abstractions

Node.js is multi threaded? or single threaded?

No!

Node is mult threaded.

Node provides two types of threads

1.Event loop thread 
   Node has only one event loop thread
 Event loop thread only handles non blocking IO - Socket IO(NETWORK IO)

2.Worker pool threads
  Node has dedcited more no of threads called "worker pool threads"
  
 Use case:
   To run non blocking "file io"
   To Run blocking code and blocking io operations.
